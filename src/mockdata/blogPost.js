ECO Delivery uses a low-carbon fuel certified by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) body and manufactured from recycled sustainable biomass. Looking forward, HAY will use ECO Delivery for our Europe and APAC ocean transport, and we see this as an important step in our journey towards a more sustainable and responsible way of running our business.",
