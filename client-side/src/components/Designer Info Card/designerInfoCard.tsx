            Thomas Bentzen is a Danish designer who founded his own studio in
            Copenhagen in 2010. Previously, he was a partner at Studio Louise
            Campbell, where he worked for five years. He is a board member of
            the Danish Cabinetmakers Autumn Exhibition (SE) and an occasional
            teacher at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Design.
            Bentzen is a methodical designer, who seeks to create fine-tuned
            products that are both engaging and durable. He works in the classic
            tradition of Scandinavian design â€“ with a pragmatic, unassuming and
            universal outlook. Against this backdrop, he has shown a talent for
            creating designs that are imbued with a contemporary feel that spark
            a sense of joy too. For HAY, Bentzen has designed the DLM Table and
            Shade Bin.
